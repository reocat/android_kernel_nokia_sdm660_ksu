config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	default n
	depends on SHMEM
	help
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

config ANDROID_VSOC
	tristate "Android Virtual SoC support"
	default n
	depends on PCI_MSI
	help
	  This option adds support for the Virtual SoC driver needed to boot
	  a 'cuttlefish' Android image inside QEmu. The driver interacts with
	  a QEmu ivshmem device. If built as a module, it will be called vsoc.

config ONESHOT_SYNC
	bool "One shot sync objects"
	depends on SYNC
	help
	  This sync driver provides a way to create sync objects that may
	  be signaled by userspace. Unlike other sync objects, the
	  sync objects created by this driver may be signaled in any order
	  without changing the state of other sync objects on the timeline.

config ONESHOT_SYNC_USER
	bool "Userspace API for ONESHOT_SYNC"
	depends on SYNC
	help
	  Provide a userspace API for creating oneshot sync objects.

config ANDROID_VSOC
	tristate "Android Virtual SoC support"
	default n
	depends on PCI_MSI
	---help---
	  This option adds support for the Virtual SoC driver needed to boot
	  a 'cuttlefish' Android image inside QEmu. The driver interacts with
	  a QEmu ivshmem device. If built as a module, it will be called vsoc.
